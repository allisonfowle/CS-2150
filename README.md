# CS-2150
CS 2150: Program and Data Representation at University of Virginia
This repository is a conglomeration of code I have written for my coding class at UVA. 
The code is mostly in C++, with Assembly, Bash, Shell, and Makefiles thrown in. 



Lab 1: Introduction to C++
Objective: This laboratory is intentended to get you up to speed quickly with both C++ and Unix
Prelab: Recursive function to compute exponentiation
Inlab: Separate the object lifecycle code to better follow C++ conventions
Postlab: Write a simple bank account class


Lab 2: Linked Lists
Objective: This laboratory introduces you to some advanced class development in C++, creating and using iterators, manipulating pointers, and linked data structures. It also addresses some issues involving testing and software development.
Prelab: Implement a Linked List: methods insertAtTail, first, size, and printList
Inlab: Use the debugger to find and correct errors in debug.cpp 
Postlab: Finish implementing a Linked List


Lab 3: Stacks
Objective: To understand the workings of a stack as well as postfix notation, and to be introduced to the C++ Standard Template Library (STL).
Prelab: Implement a postfix stack calculator (just addition and subtraction) for integers using the C++ STL Stack.
Inlab: Expand the postfix stack calculator to handle negative numbers, multiplication, division, and negation
Postlab: Implement a stack class, instead of using the STL stack


Lab 4: Number Representation
Objective: To become familiar with the underlying representation of various data types, and to learn how to examine these representations in the debugger.
Prelab: Create sizeOfTest() - a function to view the sizes of various types, overflow() - a function to investiage how C++ handles integer overflow, and outputBinary() - a function to display the binary representations of integers
Inlab: Investigate how variables and arrays are represented in memory
Postlab: Create a recursive bit counter function to count the number of 1s in the binary representation of an integer, as well as a converter function to convert integers from one base to another


Lab 5: Trees
Objective: Learn about binary trees, see tree traversals in the context of a useful application, understand tree rotations, implement a binary search tree and an AVL tree, and evaluate the performance of binary search trees and AVL trees
Prelab: Create a postfix tree calculator
Inlab: Implement a binary search tree
Postlab: Implement an AVL tree


Lab 6: Hashing
Objective: The purpose of this lab is to gain experience using hash tables by building an interesting application.
Prelab: Create a word puzzle solver
Inlab: Use the -O2 optimization flag and create a shell script to calculate the average running time of the program
Postlab: Optimize implementation of prelab word solver puzzle


Lab 7: IBCM
Objective: To become familiar with programming with IBCM and understand how high-level language programs are represented at the machine level.
Background: IBCM (Itty Bitty Computing Machine) is a simulated computer with a minimal instruction set. Despite its tiny instruction set, IBCM can compute anything that a modern computer can, and is Turing complete.
Prelab: Write two recursive programs: addition and array
Inlab: Implement a bubble sort in IBCM
Postlab: Implement a quine in IBCM


Lab 8: x86 Assembly Part 1
Objective: This lab is one of two labs meant to familiarize you with the process of writing, assembling, and linking assembly language code. The purposes of the in-lab and post-lab activities are to investigate how various C++ language features are implemented at the assembly level.
Prelab: Create two x86 function to compute the product and power of two numbers 
Inlab: Create an x86 function to perform merge sort
Postlab: Create an x86 function to perform a linear search


Lab 9: x86 Assembly Part 2
Objective: This lab is one of two labs meant to familiarize you with the process of writing, assembling, and linking assembly language code. The purposes of the in-lab and in-lab activities are to investigate how various C++ language features are implemented at the assembly level.
Prelab: Create an x86 function to demonstrate the Collatz conjecture
Inlab: Implement a linked list in C
Postlab: Create an x86 function to perform a binary search


Lab 10: Huffman Coding
Objective: To become familiar with prefix codes, to implement a useful application using a variety of data structures, to analyze the efficiency of your implementation
Prelab: Create a heap and implement Huffman encoding 
Inlab: Implement Huffman decoding


Lab 11: Graphs
Objective: To become familiar with representing graphs in general, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), topological sorting, traveling salesperson problem, and other related algorithms.
Prelab: Create a program to compute a topological sort of a graph
Inlab: Implement a brute-force traveling salesperson solution
Postlab: Write an 8-Puzzle solver using Breadth-First Search
